# ComplexSystemsProject - Investigating SOC In Financial Markets

## INTRODUCTION
This project aims to explore the concept of self-organized criticality in financial markets. Inspired by the cyclical patterns observed in stock prices, this research examines whether the financial market model meets the four conditions of SOC and identifies the role of fundamentalists and network structures in these dynamics.

## STRUCTURE
/Project Folder/networks.py: The network framework for the model, containing information spreading and avalanches in the network.
/Project Folder/trader.py: Defines the Trader classes and price decision functions.
/Project Folder/hypothesis_testing.py: Defines the power-law test function and multiple runs power-law test function.
/Project Folder/ploting.py: All plots function. (Price price time series, information time series, power-law fitting, prices change from fundamental price, normalized returns (q-gaussian fitting, Quantile-Quantile plot)
/Project Folder/Main.ipynb: The main entry point for running model simulations.

## DATA
The data used in the simulations is generated by the model based on predefined rules mimicking market behaviors and model defination.
